## üìù Internship Task Description: File Handling in C
üìå Task Name:
‚ÄúCreating, Writing, Appending, and Reading from Files in C‚Äù

üõ† Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: C

Text Editor/IDE Used: Code blocks

Compiler Used: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Windows

Operating System: Windows 11

Command Line Interface: Windows Terminal / Command Prompt

üí° Task Overview:
As part of my Computer Science internship project in the first year, I was given the task of writing a C program that performs basic file operations. The objective of this task was to understand how to create and manage files in the C programming language using standard input/output functions.

File handling is one of the most important concepts in C because it allows programs to store data permanently. Without file handling, once a program ends, all data is lost. So this program teaches how to handle real-world data storage using .txt files.

üß† What This Program Does:
This C program performs four main file operations:

Create a file and write data into it

Append more data to the existing file without deleting previous content

Read and display the content of the file

Exit the program using a menu system

The user is shown a simple menu where they can select which action they want to perform. Based on the user‚Äôs choice, the respective function is called to handle the file.

The file used in this program is named intern_file.txt, and it gets created in the same folder where the C program is saved and compiled.

üîç Why This Program is Useful:
This kind of program has real-world use in many basic and intermediate software applications. Here are some scenarios where this type of file-handling code is useful:

Log files: Programs often write logs of what they‚Äôre doing (errors, events, etc.) into a text file.

User data saving: Games, note-taking apps, and small tools use text files to store data input by users.

Data export/import: Programs that generate reports or store form inputs write that information into a file that can later be read or transferred.

This is a beginner-level project that forms the foundation for more advanced file handling like binary files, file parsing, and database interactions.

üìö Concepts Learned:
Through this project, I learned and applied the following programming concepts:

How to open files in different modes ("r", "w", "a")

How to write strings into a file using fputs()

How to read from a file using fgets()

How to handle file pointers and check if the file was opened successfully

Using functions in C to modularize code and improve readability

Menu-driven logic using while loops and switch statements

üë®‚Äçüíª Platform and Execution:
The code was written and tested using Visual Studio Code as the editor and compiled using GCC compiler through the terminal. The environment used was Windows 10, but the same code can be compiled and run on Linux or macOS as well with little or no changes.

The file created (intern_file.txt) can be found in the same directory as the source code, and it remains saved even after the program exits ‚Äî which demonstrates persistent data storage, unlike variables which are temporary.

üßæ Conclusion:
This program gave me hands-on experience with real programming tasks and taught me how to interact with the file system using C. The menu-based design makes the program user-friendly, and each function is clearly separated, which makes the code easy to understand and modify later.

Such projects are foundational for anyone learning C and help in building confidence to handle larger programming assignments in the future ‚Äî like report generation, student records, or configuration file processing.

This task gave me a good understanding of how software applications manage files behind the scenes, and I believe it will be very useful for my future academic and real-world programming work.
